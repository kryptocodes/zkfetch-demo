# zkfetch demo


simple demo to show how zkFetch can be used to generate zero knowledge proofs for oauth applications like twitter. The demo is split into two parts:

- [backend](backend/README.md): express server to handle twitter auth and generate zkp using zkFetch
- [frontend](frontend/README.md): next.js app to handle user login and display the generated zkp and verify it

Please refer to the respective READMEs for more information on how to run the demo.
